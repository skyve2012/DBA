## Overview

**Dataset Bias Analysis** is a framework for correcting the bias and discrepancies between the training set and the testing set for a higher test set performance given the prevalent of _subpopulation shift_.
This repo conains the implementation code of the framework, which is published as a the paper [Boosting Test Performance with Importance Sampling--a Subpopulation Perspective](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.13003) (Shen et al., AAAI 2025).
